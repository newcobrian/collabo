The information you allow Views to access varies by game and the social networking site (SNS), and it is affects by the privacy settings you establish at the SNS.

By playing a Views game through an SNS, you are authorizing Views to collect, store, and use in accordance with this Privacy Policy any and all information that you agreed the SNS could provide to Views through the SNS Application Programming Interface (&quot;API&quot;). Your agreement takes place when you &quot;accept&quot; or &quot;allow&quot; (or similar terms) one of our applications on a SNS.

These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (&ldquo;IP&rdquo;) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5 c7">Clear Gifs Information: &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">When you use the Service, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to track the online usage patterns of our users anonymously. &nbsp;In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients. &nbsp;The information is used to enable more accurate reporting, improve the effectiveness of our marketing, and make Views better for our users.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c5 c7">Third Party Services:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Views uses third party analytics services such as Google Analytics to help understand use of the Service. Third party analytics services collect the information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, including cookies and your IP address. Third party analytics services also receive this information and their use of it is governed by their Privacy Policy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5 c7">How We Use Your Information</span></p><a href="#" name="id.1c6774883142"></a><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c2">We use the personal information you submit to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c2">By providing Views your email address (including by &ldquo;following,&rdquo; &ldquo;liking,&rdquo; adding the Views application, linking your account to the Views service, etc., on a third party website or network), you consent to our using the email address to send you Service-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. &nbsp;You also agree that we may send you notifications of activity on the Service to the email address you give us, in accordance with any applicable privacy settings. &nbsp;We may use your email address to send you other messages, such as newsletters, changes to features of the Service, or special offers. &nbsp;If you do not want to receive such email messages, you may opt out by contacting </span><span class="c8">unsubscribe@myviews.io</span><span class="c2">. &nbsp;Opting out may prevent you from receiving email messages regarding updates, improvements, or offers. &nbsp;You may not opt out of Service-related e-mails. </span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c2">Following termination or deactivation of your Member account, Views may retain your profile information and User Content for a commercially reasonable time for backup, archival, or audit purposes. &nbsp;Furthermore, Views may retain and continue to use indefinitely all information (including User Content) contained in your communications to other Users or posted to public or semi-public areas of the Service after termination or deactivation of your Member account.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Views may use certain information about you and/or your User Content internally for purposes such as analyzing how the Service is used, diagnosing service or technical problems, maintaining security, and personalizing content. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Views reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor the User Content you post on the Service. We reserve the right to remove any such information or material for any reason or no reason, including without limitation if in our sole opinion such information or material violates, or may violate, any applicable law or our Terms of Use Agreement, or to protect or defend our rights or property or those of any third party. &nbsp;Views also reserves the right to remove information upon the request of any third party.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c2">We use cookies, clear gifs, device identifiers and/or log file information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our Service; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems reported by our Users or engineers that are associated with certain IP addresses; (f) help you efficiently access your information after you sign in; and (h) track User Content and Users to the extent necessary to comply as a service provider with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act; and (i) automatically update the Views application on your system and related devices.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5 c7">How We Share Your Information</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c5">Personally Identifiable Information: </span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Views will not rent or sell your personally identifiable information to others. &nbsp;Views may share your personally identifiable information with third parties for the purpose of providing the Service to you. &nbsp;If we do this, such third parties&rsquo; use of your information will be bound by this Privacy Policy. &nbsp;We may store personal information in locations outside the direct control of Views (for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers).</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c8">As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings. Customer, email, and visitor information is generally one of the transferred business assets in these types of transactions. We may also transfer or assign such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or dissolution. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c8">Any personal information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service, such as User Content, becomes available to the public, as controlled by any applicable privacy settings. &nbsp;If you remove information that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Service, or if other Users have copied or saved that information. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c8">From time to time, we may run contests, special offers, or other events or activities (&ldquo;Events&rdquo;) on the Service together with a third party partner. &nbsp;If you provide information to such third parties, you give them permission to use it for the purpose of that Event and any other use that you approve. We cannot control third parties&rsquo; use of your information. If you do not want your information to be collected by or shared with a third party, you can choose not to participate in these Events.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c2">Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, Views will not disclose personal information to any third party unless required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the law, comply with legal process served on us or our affiliates, or investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities; (b) to enforce our Terms of Use </span><span class="c8">(</span><span class="c8 c14"><a class="c1" href="http://myviews.io/terms">http://myviews.io/terms</a></span><span class="c8">)</span><span class="c2">, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, or to protect the security or integrity of our site; and (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Views, our Users or others.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c5">Non-Personally Identifiable Information: </span><span class="c8">&nbsp;We may share non-personally identifiable information (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third parties to help them understand the usage patterns for certain Views services.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c8">Views may allow third-party ad servers or ad networks to serve advertisements on the Service. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on Views. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or web beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content. &nbsp;Views does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent. However, please note that if an advertiser asks Views to show an advertisement to a certain audience and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. &nbsp;In addition, third-party advertisers may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. The Views Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, third-party advertisers. &nbsp;Please consult the respective privacy policies of such advertisers for more information. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5 c7">How We Protect Your Information</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Views cares about the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Views or guarantee that your information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. &nbsp;Your privacy settings may also be affected by changes to the functionality of Views&rsquo; distributors, such as social networks. &nbsp;Views is not responsible for the functionality or security measures of any third party. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you access to your account. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your account information and for controlling access to your email communications from Views, at all times.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c5 c7">Compromise of Personal Information</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2">In the event that personal information is compromised as a result of a breach of security, Views will promptly notify those persons whose personal information has been compromised, in accordance with the notification procedures set forth in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required by applicable law.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c5 c7">Your Choices About Your Information</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c2">You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information through the Service, in which case Views may not be able to provide certain services to you. You may update or correct your account information and email preferences at any time by contacting </span><span class="c8">unsubscribe@myviews.io</span><span class="c2">. &nbsp; You can review and correct the information about you that Views keeps on file by contacting us directly at </span><span class="c8">contact@myviews.io</span><span class="c2">. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5 c7">Children&#39;s Privacy</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. &nbsp;For that reason, Views does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register as Members. If you are under 13, please do not send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 13 is allowed to provide any personal information to or on Views. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.
